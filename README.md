# **Rigid Pendulum**
## Question 1
If the frequency of the drive was higher than the natural frequency of the pendulum, I would expect the material to be under some stress depending on how much mass is hanging from the pendulum and the material it is made of. If the frequency of the drive is lower then the nature frequency, I would expect the pendulum to undergo the same amount of stresses. In either case, I would expect the pendulum to continuously attempt to reach equilibrium in terms of the frequency.
## Question 2
I would guess that the pendulums displacement angle would be dependent on the angular momentum and the amount of the displacement (how far down the pendulum is moved).
## Question 3
My expectation would be that the pendulum would move almost the same as if the downward movement hadn't occured, but would take slightly longer to begin it's oscillating movement.
